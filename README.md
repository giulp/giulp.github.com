##What is ng-Resume?

`ng-Resume` is a simple AngularJS app that renders JSON content into a a responsive web page formatted like a resume/CV. It is lightweight and can be quickly changed to meet your needs. It also provides a quick search function that allows visitors to conveniently browse through the resume to find relevant details.  
  

##Usage

The `json` folder is where the content of the resume, the titles and labels are stored and can be edited.  
For advanced setup, you can modify or create sections as components. 
Shared templates are stored in `components/_common`  

**You can see the app live in action [here](http://giulp.github.io).**
